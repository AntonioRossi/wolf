#Wolf
Trade foreign exchange with ease.

### Introduction
Wolf Trading Platform is an interactive platform that supports real-time financial data visualization, as well as historical data lookup. It executes simple trading rules in real time and is simple to integrate with the brokerage services. It is currently available [here](http://ec2-54-183-118-188.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/wolf/graph.new). You might have to wait a couple of seconds for the system to initialize. This interface was tested on Google Chrome Version 35.0.1916.153.

Below is an overview of the architecture of Wolf:

Wolf uses the following modules:

  1. Data.provider is responsible for a real-time Forex feed to the system. To have that free of charge it uses data aggregated by [Hist Data](histdata.com) every month. The data feed is therefore one month old, e.g., a tick that happened in June at exactly '2014-06-03 15:32:21.451 EST' is fed to the system on July at exactly '2014-07-03 15:32:21.451 EST'. This approach helps generating traffic similar to what expensive data providers would provide. The downside is, apart from data being one-month old, the fact that a regular weekday in July might have been a weekend in June, which causes outage in feed.
  2. Restful.rule.submission is responsible for getting user-defined orders from investors. They are defined as simple IF THEN trading rues. Rules are delivered to the rule.engine and executed if the condition specified in the order is met. All rules enter the system via this API. Web.interface calls this API when user "clicks" to submit a rule.
  3. Data.router is responsible for getting events generated by producers: "ticks" from data.provider and orders from restful.rule.submission and deliver them to the appropriate consumers. It is built on top of [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) distributed queue.
  4. Rule.engine is one of the consumers of events provided by data.router. It matches up rules with the current state of the market and executes the trades when the conditions specified in rules are met. It is built on top of [Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/) event processor. The design of rule.engine is showed below: ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slawekj/wolf/master/images/engine.png "Architecture of Rule Engine") There are two spouts: one provides ticks, one provides rules. It is a simple design, which matches up rules with ticks by the "symbol" field, e.g. it uses Storm field grouping. Execution bolt stores partially the latest state of the market, e.g. each task "knows" only about the state of the input ticks.

  5. Data.aggregator.rt is responsible for aggregating the latest ticks in real time. It is built on top of [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) database.
  6. Data.aggregator.batch is responsible for aggregating a wide time range of ticks in batch, averaging them, and serving aggregated views to data.aggregator.rt. It is built on top of [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html), [Camus](https://github.com/linkedin/camus), and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/).
  7. Restful.cache.service.rt separates queries to the data.aggregator.rt database from clients. It uses in-memory cache to serve requests in real time.
  8. Restful.cache.service.batch works exactly like restful.cache.service.rt but for the other types of queries.

### Getting started

I am currently working on the deployment scripts, all the modules should be easy to deploy using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/slawekj/wolf.git
./wolf/<module name>/bin/install.sh
./wolf/<module name>/bin/run.sh
```
Modules should be deployed in the following order:
  1. data.router (deployment scripts ready)
  2. data.provider (deployment scripts ready)
  3. rule.engine (deployment scripts in preparation)
  4. data.aggregator.rt (deployment scripts in preparation)
  5. data.aggregator.batch (deployment scripts in preparation)
  6. restful.cache.rt (deployment scripts in preparation)
  7. restful.cache.batch (deployment scripts in preparation)
  8. restful.rule.submission (deployment scripts in preparation)
  9. web.interface (deployment scripts in preparation)

Deployment scripts are tested on Ubuntu 12.04 distribution, which is available [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04.4-server-amd64.iso). You should have sudo permissions and have git installed:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
